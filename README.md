# Financial Time Series Analysis in Python


## Overview:

Delve into the fascinating world of financial time series analysis with Python. This project focuses on exploring the historical performance of stocks, with a particular emphasis on the GME (GameStop) ticker obtained through the yfinance library. By leveraging time series analysis techniques, we aim to visualize stock performance, make forecasts, and employ models such as AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).

## Key Objectives:

1. **Data Retrieval:** Utilize the yfinance library to retrieve historical stock data for the GME ticker.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the financial time series, exploring trends, patterns, and key statistical measures.

3. **Visualization:** Employ visualizations to illustrate the historical performance of GME, providing insights into stock movements and potential trends.

4. **Forecasting Models:**
   - **AIC and BIC:** Implement the AIC and BIC criteria for model selection, aiding in the identification of the most suitable time series model.
   - **ARIMA:** Develop AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average models for forecasting future stock prices.

5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of forecasting models, considering accuracy, precision, and other relevant metrics.

## Project Structure:

1. **Data Retrieval and Preprocessing:** Fetch historical stock data using yfinance, clean the data, and prepare it for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the time series data, identifying patterns, trends, and outliers.

3. **Visualization:** Create visual representations of GME stock performance, including line charts, moving averages, and other relevant plots.

4. **AIC and BIC Model Selection:** Implement AIC and BIC criteria to choose the optimal model for time series forecasting.

5. **ARIMA Model Development:** Build ARIMA models for predicting future stock prices based on historical data.

6. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the accuracy and effectiveness of forecasting models through quantitative metrics.

7. **Interpretation and Insights:** Derive insights from the analysis, interpreting the results and potential implications for decision-making.
